          ERROR SCREENSHOTS & STUCK POINTS DOCUMENTATION
                    All Errors We Faced During Development
================================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
This document is based on TEXT DESCRIPTIONS of errors from conversation 
history and documentation. I (AI Assistant) do not have access to actual 
screenshot image files. Below are all the errors mentioned in conversations
and what they would have shown on screen.

================================================================================
                    ERROR #1: HOSTINGER BLANK PAGE
        (Conversation: 9d2237d7 - Hostinger Frontend Deployment)
================================================================================

WHEN IT HAPPENED:
-----------------
Week 3 - First deployment attempt to Hostinger (ai.technoamaze.in)

WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN ON SCREEN:
------------------------------------
Screenshot 1: Browser showing blank white page
  URL: https://ai.technoamaze.in
  Display: Completely blank screen, no content
  
Screenshot 2: Browser Developer Console (F12)
  Multiple red errors:
  ❌ 404 (Not Found) - /_next/static/css/[hash].css
  ❌ 404 (Not Found) - /_next/static/chunks/[hash].js
  ❌ 404 (Not Found) - /_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-[hash].js
  
Screenshot 3: Network Tab
  All _next/ folder requests showing red (404)
  Status: 404 Not Found
  Type: text/html (should be application/javascript or text/css)

WHAT WE WERE STUCK ON:
----------------------
✗ Next.js static export not working on Apache server
✗ _next folder files not being served
✗ Incorrect MIME types being returned
✗ Apache not recognizing Next.js routing structure

ERROR MESSAGES:
---------------
Browser Console:
  "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)"
  "GET https://ai.technoamaze.in/_next/static/css/app.css net::ERR_ABORTED 404"
  "Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined"

Apache Error (if you checked server logs):
  "File does not exist: /public_html/_next/static/chunks/..."

HOW WE FIXED IT:
----------------
✓ Created comprehensive .htaccess file
✓ Added proper MIME type declarations
✓ Implemented URL rewrite rules for Next.js
✓ Verified _next folder was uploaded completely
✓ Created DEPLOYMENT_HOSTINGER.md guide

================================================================================
              ERROR #2: RENDER BACKEND PATH ERROR
          (Conversation: 6d29f3ad - Resolve Render Video Errors)
================================================================================

WHEN IT HAPPENED:
-----------------
Week 3 - After deploying mock_server.py to Render.com

WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN ON SCREEN:
------------------------------------
Screenshot 1: Frontend video generation page
  Status: "Processing..."
  Progress: Stuck at "Generating audio..."
  No completion, no download link

Screenshot 2: Browser Console Error
  Red error message:
  ❌ GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/download/[job-id] net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
  
Screenshot 3: Render.com Dashboard - Logs
  Server error in logs:
  ```
  ERROR: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/antigravity/[job-id].mp4'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "mock_server.py", line 298, in download_video
      return FileResponse(video_path, ...)
  FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
  ```

Screenshot 4: Frontend showing incorrect download URL
  Download URL shown: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/download/abc123
  Should be: https://technoaiamaze-video-creator.onrender.com/api/v1/download/abc123

WHAT WE WERE STUCK ON:
----------------------
✗ Hardcoded localhost URLs in response
✗ Files generated but path not found on download
✗ Video generation completing but download failing
✗ Frontend showing "Video ready" but 404 on download

ERROR MESSAGES:
---------------
Python Backend Error:
  "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/antigravity/[uuid].mp4'"

Frontend Console:
  "Failed to fetch video: Network request failed"
  "GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/download/[id] net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

API Response (Status endpoint):
  {
    "status": "completed",
    "result_url": "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/download/abc123"  ← WRONG URL
  }

HOW WE FIXED IT:
----------------
✓ Changed to dynamic URL generation using request.base_url
✓ Updated download endpoint to handle missing files
✓ Added multiple file format fallbacks (.mp4, .gif, .png, .txt)
✓ Fixed path concatenation for cross-platform compatibility

================================================================================
                ERROR #3: CORS ERRORS
          (Conversation: 6d29f3ad - Backend API Issues)

  from origin 'https://ai.technoamaze.in' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
  ```

Screenshot 2: Network Tab
  Request to Render.com backend showing:
  Status: (failed)
  Type: CORS error
  Headers: Missing Access-Control-Allow-Origin

Screenshot 3: Frontend UI
  Error message shown to user:

✗ Hostinger domain not in allowed origins list
✗ Pre-flight OPTIONS requests failing

ERROR MESSAGES:
---------------
Browser Console:
  "Access to fetch at 'https://technoaiamaze-video-creator.onrender.com' 
   from origin 'https://ai.technoamaze.in' has been blocked by CORS policy"
  
  "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"

HOW WE FIXED IT:
----------------
✓ Added ai.technoamaze.in to CORS_ORIGINS
✓ Used regex pattern for flexible origin matching
✓ Updated mock_server.py CORS middleware
✓ Redeployed backend to Render
✓ Tested with fetch() in browser console

  ```

Screenshot 4: Code showing problematic line
  In engines/audio_synthesizer.py:
  ```python
  output_path = "/tmp/antigravity/audio.mp3"  ← LINUX PATH, fails on Windows
  ```

WHAT WE WERE STUCK ON:

Should use:
  tempfile.gettempdir() for cross-platform paths

HOW WE'RE FIXING IT:
--------------------
⚠️ IN PROGRESS
✓ Created LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md
✓ Created setup_local.bat
⚠️ Need to update all engines to use tempfile.gettempdir()
⚠️ Need to test full pipeline on Windows
